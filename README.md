Sea of Clouds - Twitter Widget
=======================

A twitter widget, based on the 'Sea of Clouds' script. The most often used
options can be configured in the `config.yml` file. If you wish to change either
the default CSS or the default javascript, you should copy the files from
`SeaOfCloudsWidget/assets` to another file in that same folder. That way, they
will not be overwritten when you update the extension.
